# ☽ Tarot Project ☾

This site produces tarot card readings for the horseshoe spread to help you find a new perspective on a specific problem. 

### Learning Goals

This is my first project. I picked this project with the intention of learning data structures & object oriented programming as well as implementing callback functions. Because the tarot deck has 78 cards that can be presented upside up or upside down (2 orientations) and the horsehoe spread involves 7 positions, I choose to house the 1092 reading combinations in a three layer nested object. In the future this project will be able to save your readings & help me to continue learning about node, AJAX requests & databases. 

### Features To Build

1. Add the option to choose if your problem is related to relationships, finances, career or health & happiness. Readings will produce strings that are specifically related to the subject selected. 
2. Add the option to save your reading with a note so that you can document the question or problem related to the reading. Log in via facebook/google/twitter to save? 
3. Add sharing to twitter & facebook. 
4. Add other tarot spreads.
