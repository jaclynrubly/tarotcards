#Issues

These are the tasks I am setting out for myself on this project. This list will grow exponentially but it will also keep me on task & help keep this project moving forward. 

- [ ] In deal.js, add a class for the position that the card is dealt to. 
- [x] Format the deck object. _September 23, 2015_ 
- [ ] Fill deck object with "readings".
- [x] Write a function that has a 50/50 chance of dealing the card upside down & registering that orientation for the output of "readings". _Completed 09/12/2015_
- [ ] Utilize AJAX (?) to output "readings" after cards have been dealt.
- [ ] Create multiple interpretations so that the readings have more variety.
- [ ] Wireframe a front end layout.
- [ ] Build out the app's CSS.
- [ ] Build around the app a site design.
- [ ] Make sure all the design is responsive.
- [ ] Change deck/deal image.
- [ ] Arrange for the cards dealt to be positioned in an arch on the center of the page
- [ ] Redact the code to deal the random card from the object (as opposed to the original array) in order to stay DRY.
